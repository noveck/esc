This is a javascript console part of a cyber escape room game. A room needs to be furnished with clues and traps, and then the participants will use this console to enter the info to solve.

Ths is an alpha release, so the clues, traps etc are hardcoded in the script.js file. When I get time maybe I'll make it a little more customizable.
